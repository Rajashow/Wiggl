# How it works
Using Pose Net from Tensorflow, we were able to take a video feed and compute the location of a human body in the shot. With this, we are able to compare live feed from a webcam with a video of a professional (or amazing amatuer) dancing. Written in JavaSCript with a NodeJS backend and a ReactJS frontend.



# TODO
- Add larger multiplayer functionality
- Optimze processing of poses
- Improve mobile layout
